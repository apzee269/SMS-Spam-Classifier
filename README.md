# SMS Spam Classifier

Introduction
This is a machine learning project to classify text messages as either spam or not spam. It uses the SMS Spam Collection dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository to train the model. The dataset contains over 5,000 text messages, which have been classified by humans as either spam or not spam.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/apzee269/SMS-Spam-Classifier.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project: python sms_spam_classifier.py
Model
This project uses the following algorithms to classify the messages:

Multinomial Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Results
The model has been trained on the SMS Spam Collection dataset, and the accuracy on the test set has been found to be around 97.8%.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to classify text messages as either spam or not spam using machine learning algorithms. The model has been trained on a small dataset and can be further improved by using more advanced algorithms and larger datasets.
